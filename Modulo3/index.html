		<h3 class="text-center">Buñuelos</h3>
		<p>A buñuelo (Spanish: [buˈɲwelo]) (alternatively called bimuelo, birmuelo, bermuelo, burmuelo, or bonuelo; Catalan: bunyol, IPA: [buˈɲɔɫ]) is a fried dough ball. It is a popular snack in Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Cuba, El Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico, Nicaragua, Puerto Rico, Ecuador, Uruguay, Spain, Venezuela, Greece, Guam, Turkey and Morocco, and is a tradition at Christmas, Ramadan, and among Sephardic Jews at Hanukkah. It will usually have a filling or a topping. In Mexican cuisine, it is often served with a syrup made with piloncillo.
<br>Buñuelos are first known to have been consumed among Spain's Morisco population. They typically 	consist of a simple, wheat-based yeast dough, often flavored with anise, that is thinly rolled, 	cut or shaped into individual pieces, then fried and finished off with a sweet topping. Buñuelos 	 may be filled with a variety of things, sweet or savory. They can be round in ball shapes or disc 		shaped. In Latin America, buñuelos are seen as a symbol of good luck.
<br>
In Colombia they are made with a small curd white cheese and formed into doughy balls then fried golden brown. It is a traditional Christmas dish, served along with natillas and manjar blanco.
In Cuba they are traditionally twisted in a figure 8 and covered in an anise caramel. The dough contains cassava and malanga.
<br>
In the Dominican Republic, buñuelos are rolled into balls from a dough made of cassava (called yuca) and eggs. They are then covered in a cinnamon sugar syrup, often using coconut milk instead of water.
In Nicaragua, buñuelos are made from a dough containing cassava, eggs, and white grating cheese. The buñuelos are rolled into balls and deep fried. They are served alongside a syrup made of sugar, water, cinnamon sticks, and cloves. They are eaten year-round, and are a typical side-dish or snack served during holidays.
<br>
In Puerto Rico, buñuelos are small and round. The dough is often made with milk, baking powder, egg, flour, apio or cassava, or grated corn that has been squeezed through a cheesecloth. They are often filled with cheese, ham, spices, and then baked. Sweet buñuelo dough contains yam or batata filled with guava and cream cheese and usually fried.
In Italy the Zeppole is a popular version of buñuelos made of dough balls about 2 inches (5.1 cm) in diameter, these doughnuts or fritters are usually topped with powdered sugar and may be filled with custard, jelly, cannoli-style pastry cream, or a butter-and-honey mixture. Their consistency ranges from light and puffy, to bread or pasta-like.

Mexican buñuelos
In Mexico buñuelos are made from a yeasted dough with a hint of anise that is deep-fried, then drenched in a syrup of brown sugar, cinnamon, and guava. Buñuelos are commonly served in Mexico and other Latin American countries with powdered sugar, a cinnamon and sugar topping, or hot sugar cane syrup (piloncillo) and are sold in fairs, carnivals, and Christmas events such as Las Posadas.
There are references to buñuelos in Majorca, Catalonia or Valencia; there are also buñuelos in Turkey, India, Puerto Rico, and Cuba; buñuelos in Russia. Jews in Turkey make buñuelos with matzo meal and eat them during Passover. They are also popular during Hanukkah</p>

		<h3 class="text-center">Ponche</h3>
		<p>Christmas time in Mexico is a time to prepare the traditional Ponche Navideño/Christmas Punch. At family gatherings some will have a large pot simmering on top of the stove with the sweet liquid full of fruits, while the cinnamon and citric fruit aromas float in the air. The Ponche Navideño is another essential part of Christmas in Mexico. The recipe calls for some traditional ingredients like cinnamon,  tejocotes (a small yellow fruit that resembles crabapples), piloncillo (raw sugar cane), sugar cane sticks, seasonal fruits include guavas, apples, pears, oranges and dry fruits, too. The punch can be found with different added fruits depending of the region in Mexico. You can find punch with acid fruits like oranges, Mexican sweet lime or pineapple. And as far as spices go, besides cinnamon, some cooks will also add anise star and chamomile. This is the good part about this drink, that you can add the fruits you have available and it will still come out fine.
		<br>
		 it's traditionally imbibed in Mexico during Christmastime. Vendors sell it at night near the sidewalk Christmas markets. It's also served with buñuelos during the posadas. No one seems to know exactly how and why Mexican ponche materialized. In general, historians seem to agree that the punch concept originated in India, where English sailors took a liking to it and brought to Europe. The Spaniards (or the French?) must have carried the tradition to Mexico. Today, the base of Mexican ponche comprises piloncillo, a dark-brown unrefined cane sugar, mixed with water and cinnamon sticks. To that, you can add pretty much any winter fruits you want: apples, oranges, guavas, tejocotes. The latter two are key. Tejocotes are small, speckled orange fruits with an apple-pear taste, and their soft flesh turns almost creamy while soaking in the ponche. Guavas lend just the right amount of tang and citrusy perfume. The smell of guavas cooking with cinnamon and sugar is intoxicating. Someday someone's going to make a million dollars selling it to Williams-Sonoma as an air freshener.
		 <br>
		 In addition to the fresh fruit, ponche can contain prunes, raisins, tamarind, walnuts. Some folks add hibiscus flowers, which gives the ponche a pretty burgundy color. Ponche isn't an exact science. Everything simmers together until the fruit is tender, and the dried fruits become plump, sugar-swollen nuggets. If you are like me, you will hover over the pan and give yourself a ponche facial, letting that sweet, spicy steam envelope your face.</p>

		<h3  class="text-center">Romeritos</h3>
		<p>Christmas is only a couple of days away and as we prepare our holiday menu, we bring in all of the recipes that are typical in the family. Latinos have turkey, tamales, mole, pozole and something called romeritos. Romeritos is a traditional Mexican dish typical of southern Mexico and served during the Christmas season. The name comes from the wild plant know as romerito, that resembles baby spinach or rosemary. The dish also consists of dried shrimp and potatoes all contained within a mole sauce.
		Romeritos is a Mexican dish from Southern Mexico, consisting of sprigs of a wild plant known as seepweed (Suaeda spp.). In Spanish it is known as romerito. That name in English means "little rosemary", but seepweeds do not resemble such plant. Usually, they are served with patties of dried shrimp, and potatoes in a mole sauce. They are traditionally enjoyed at Christmas and Lent.
